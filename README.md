Intro to GitHub :-)

I am excited to expand my coding horizons with GitHub!
I'm not sure why my university doesn't use GitHub, but I think this will be a valuable asset in my repetoire.
I plan to use this for my upcoming research projects and my current physics project. When I have free time, maybe I'll add personal projects, too!
